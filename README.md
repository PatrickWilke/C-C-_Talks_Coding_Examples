# C_and_Cpp_Talks_Coding_Examples
Code used as examples for C and C++ talks

This repository contains code examples from my talks and seminars on general programming topics. They do not follow any 
particular system but are just based on peoples interests. Some are ment for real applications others are purely academic. 

For example is generic programming in C++ very useful. The examples in C are ment to show that it is in principle possible
to implement generic code but it is very confusing to read and not recommanded in most cases (use if possible C++, often times it is even faster).

The same holds true for the meta programming part. It is interesting to show that a functional programming language can be
implemented at compile time using templates. However, the code gets very very confusing and using modern C++ standards better
solutions exist in practise. The n dimensional std array constitutes a useful example which could be extended.

Content on machine learning and reinforcement learning will be implemented in python and hence put in another repository.
